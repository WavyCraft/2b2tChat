# Description
In the server `2b2tmcpe.org` players can do '> <your_message>' to make their text green so it can stand out. Along with another feature which is if you do @here then everyone in the server would see it in yellow but not the whole message just the '@here' part.

Players can also do `@<player_name' to basically call out to the player. Just like the '@here' the @ is only highlighted and not the whole message!
